# Button-Paint
This is an updated version of the old Pixel Paint program. It was made in PyQt5 and features more functions than the previous program.

### About
-------------
This was my first program made with PyQt5. New improvements are new 20 colors to choose from, more image sizes and different fill picture options! <br>
Unfortunately, no export to .png or .jpg is available. <br>
WARNING! The images from old Pixel Paint are not compatible with Button Paint and vice versa. <br>
